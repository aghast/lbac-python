#
#  Each bug in the database has an associated state.
#
#  By default we support two states:
#
#   open    - The bug is still present.
#   closed  - The bug has been fixed.
#
#  You may create your own labels and choose which ones are supported by
# updating the following two settings:
#
states = open, closed
default-state = open

#
#
#  Each bug in the database may have an associated priority.
#
#  The labels you choose to asign to prorities may be specified here,
# and you may use an arbitrary number of them in order of "low" -> "high".
#
priorities = low, normal, high

#
#  Default priority to assign to new bugs.
#
default-priority = normal
