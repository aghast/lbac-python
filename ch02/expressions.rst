Expression Parsing
=================

The first part of parsing is always expression parsing. Why is that?
Well, probably because it's a simple, straightforward task with a little
bit of complexity but not too much, and because everybody already knows
the rules. We could make the first chapter about scanning sentences in
Thai, where they don't actually use spaces to separate the words. But,
statistically, not to many of my readers are going to be familiar with
Thai. And we would be jumping in at the very, very deep end, instead of
getting our feet wet in the shallows. So we won't do that.  We'll do
expressions instead. (Sorry, Thai readers!)

You should have a Python 3 development environment up and running. And
you should already have run the test cases from chapter 1. I have copied
my version of the cradle code from chapter 1 to ch02/cradle.py. If you
wrote your own versions, I encourage you to copy them over mine. Make a
copy of the cradle in the ch02 directory, and let's get started!

When we talk about expressions, we mean mathematical expressions. The
right-hand side of equations like the one below.

    y = mx + b

Except that computer languages usually require an operator to indicate
multiplication, since they allow variable names of more than one letter.

The Simplest Expression
-----------------------

The simplest expression is a single number. Let's see if we can
recognize that. In your copy of the chapter 2 cradle, add a new definition
for the `compile` function::

    def compile():
        expression()

We'll keep that throughout this chapter, since we're all about parsing
expressions right now.

Now let's parse our simple expression::

    def expression():
        emitln("Result: " + get_number())

Run that. You should get an output something like this::

    Enter your code on a single line. Enter '.' by itself to quit.
    1
    Result: 1
    2
    Result: 2
    3
    Result: 3
    .

At this point we have a working expression parser. It's not a compiler.
It's not a four-function calculator. But it does parse a well-defined subset
of mathematical expressions correctly.

We have a choice: we can start working towards parsing more types of
expressions, or we can work more towards compiling the expressions we can
successfully parse into some kind of runnable format. Because we're just
getting started, and because of the first rule, [1]_ I'm going to carry on
with the expression parsing part, and leave the code generation for later.

Top-Down Parsing
----------------

The technique we are using here is a fairly "obvious" one, in the sense that
if you sat down without reading any compiler books and thought about how to
do this task, there's a good chance you would wind up implementing this.

We are starting from a high-level aggregate name representing what we are
trying to parse (in our case, an 'expression'), and then decomposing the
higher-level objects into one or more sequences, each comprised of slightly
lower-level objects. The name for this is "Top-Down Parsing." Sometimes it
gets other names, like "Recursive Descent Parsing."

A fundamental principle, which you may love or loathe, is that when a
higher-level object is decomposed into lower-level objects, you write a
function to represent each object (or call a function that was already
written). Keep this in mind- we'll be doing it a lot.

Binary Expressions
------------------

Everyone understands four-function calculators. A few numbers, a couple of
operator symbols. Maybe there's a memory function, that nobody really uses.
Let's head in that direction with our code. We'll add some operators and see
how that works.

First, let's define our operators. We're going to use the standard plus (+),
minus(-), and multiply(*) from most C-like languages. We'll be using the
division(/) operation, too, but we'll do integer division rather than
floating point. (At this point, Python is handling the math for us, so we
could support floating point easily. But when we're compiling to some other
code, I don't want to set expectations too high.)

As everyone knows, a binary expression looks like "1 + 2" or "8 / 4". Our
`expression` code can handle that. Just remember that `get_number` returns
a string::

    def expression():
        num1 = int(get_number())
        op = get_char()
        num2 = int(get_number())
        if op == '+':
                result = expr_add(num1, num2)
        elif op == '-':
                result = expr_subtract(num1, num2)
        elif op == '*':
                result = expr_multiply(num1, num2)
        elif op == '/':
                result = expr_divide(num1, num2)
        emitln("Result: %d" % result)

And we'll need four helper functions for the operations. Here's the divide
function- remember that '//' is Python's "floor division" operator. Please
add all four::

    def expr_divide(num, denom):
        return num // denom

Go ahead and add all four of the helpers, and run the program. The output
looks good::

    Enter your code on a single line. Enter '.' by itself to quit.
    1+7
    Result: 8
    9-3
    Result: 6
    2*5
    Result: 10
    9/2
    Result: 4
    .

Now, try parsing one of the single-digit expressions from our earlier
version::

    3

    'Number' expected.

It seems like our binary-expression parser is a little too demanding. What
exactly happened, there? Looking at the code for `expression` we can see
that the first call to `get_number` would return the '3' that was input. The
next call, to `get_char` is going to get whatever is returned next -
including the None that is returned at end of input. We don't do any kind of
checking on that input, and that's a problem by itself. Next, though, we get
another call to `get_number` that *does* validate its input. And that is
where the error is coming from.

There are a couple of problems, so let's try to solve them all together.  We
"lost" some functionality that we had just a moment ago. So it's time to put
in a test suite, with some regression tests to make sure we don't "lose"
any more behavior. And we somehow forgot how to parse simple expressions.
We'll have to allow for the possibility of either simple single-digit
expressions or more complex binary expressions. Fnally, we'll want to
test for legal operators in a more active fashion.

Testing Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We're going to be doing a lot of the same kind of test: call our code with a
particular input string, and assert that the output matches a given string.
Before we do anything else, let's add a helper for that to the
cradle_tests.py file in the tests directory. Here's my stab at it::

    class TestCradle(unittest.TestCase):

        def assertExpr(self, text, result):
            want = "Result: %d" % int(result)
            compiler.init(inp=StringIO(text), out=self.stdout, err=self.stderr)
            compiler.compile()
            output = self.stdout.getvalue().split("\n")[-2]
            self.assertEqual(output, want)

Make a copy of the ch02/tests/cradle_tests.py module to another name in the
tests directory. I called my first parser expr1.py, so I'll use
expr1_tests.py. Then let's write some tests::

    def test_add(self):
        self.assertExpr('1+8', 9)
        self.assertExpr('7+4', 11)

    def test_subtract(self):
        self.assertExpr("8-3", 5)
        self.assertExpr("4-4", 0)

    def test_multiply(self):
        self.assertExpr("3*2", 6)
        self.assertExpr("1*8", 8)

    def test_divide(self):
        self.assertExpr("2/2", 1)
        self.assertExpr("3/2", 1)
        self.assertExpr("6/2", 3)

Run nosetests and make sure everything is working as expected. Note that in
Python 3 the default division behavior has changed - two integers will
return a floating point result unless the 'floor division' operator (//) is
used. Testing for this is important.

Once you have a working set of binary expression test cases, let's go back
and add some regression tests to handle the "simple expression" case you
handled before::

    def test_simple(self):
        self.assertExpr("1", 1)
        self.assertExpr("9", 9)

Whoops! That test doesn't pass, does it? And it still doesn't produce a very
good message describing the problem. Let's add a test case, and some more
code::

    def test_bogus_operator(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit):
            self.assertExpr("1^1", 1)
        self.assertEqual(self.stderr.getvalue(), "\n'BinOp' expected.\n")

Checking Every Input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we can check for a valid operator before we do anything with it.
And while we're making changes, let's put the work of handling the operator,
and the following operand, down into the helper functions::

    def expression():
        result = int(get_number())

        if Peek is not None:
            if Peek not in "+-*/":
                expected('BinOp')
            elif Peek == '+':
                result = expr_add(result)
            elif Peek == '-':
                result = expr_subtract(result)
            elif Peek == '*':
                result = expr_multiply(result)
            else:
                result = expr_divide(result)

        emitln("Result: %d" % result)

    def expr_divide(num):
        match('/')
        num2 = int(get_number())
        result = num // num2
        emitln(".. computed %d // %d = %d", num, num2, result)
        return result

In this version of `expression,` we have support for both the 'simple' form
with just a single number, and the binary form, where an operator follows
the number. The ``Peek is not None`` test is our check for end-of-input.

Each operator has a case just for it, and we don't try to do too much work
in the `expression` function- instead we rely on the dedicated code to
handle that.

A Bug is Found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding this change reduces our test failures to one. We are handling the
simple expression case, and it looks like this code should work, but it
turns out there is a bug in the `get_char` code - the :py:meth:`File.read`
method is defined as being able to return an empty string in cases when no
bytes are available for reading. This is intended for asynchronous devices-
like a keyboard- where it makes sense to check for some input now, and
check again later in case the user types something. But for our
:py:class:`StringIO` objects, returning an empty string means that the
object has reached its end, and so we should consider that to mean EOF for
this program.

Let's fix `get_char` now, test case and all. First, the test case::

    def test_read_at_eof(self):
        compiler.init(StringIO('ab'))
        self.assertEqual(compiler.get_char(), 'a')
        self.assertEqual(compiler.get_char(), 'b')
        self.assertIsNone(compiler.get_char())

Next, run the tests, which shows us this error::

    ======================================================================
    FAIL: test_read_at_eof (expr1_tests.TestCradle)
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/Users/austin/git/lbac/ch02/tests/expr1_tests.py", line 61, in
      test_read_at_eof
          self.assertIsNone(compiler.get_char())
          AssertionError: '' is not None

Finally, let's fix this problem::

    def get_char():
        """
        Advance the input to the next character. Return the character consumed,
        or None. Note that this function changes `Peek`, and returns the *old*
        value of `Peek`.
        """
        global Peek
        result = Peek
        Peek = _Input.read(1) if _Input.readable() else None
    >    if Peek == '':
    >        # StringIO and tty objects can be 'readable but empty now'.
    >        Peek = None
        return result

With those changes installed, the code works as expected. The `get_char`
function now returns None when it reaches the end of the string buffer, and
the expression-parsing code now handles both the *simple* and *binary*
expression types, as needed.

Really Long Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sadly, the code only handles a single binary operator. We can't input a
string of operations, like 1+2*4/3. Let's add a test case for multiple
binary operators::

    def test_multiple_binops(self):
        self.assertExpr("1+2*4/3", 4)
        self.assertExpr("8-5+3/6*9", 9)

This doesn't pass, because `expression` expects a single operator. We'll
have to add a loop to the expression parser to check for possibly-many
binary operators. Go ahead and change the `if` statement to a `while`,
so the code can keep on trucking. Note that the rest of the code is
pretty robust, which makes it easy to change things. ::

    def expression():
        result = int(get_number())
        while Peek is not None:
            if Peek not in "+-*/":
                expected('BinOp')
            if Peek == '+':
                result = expr_add(result)
            elif Peek == '-':
                result = expr_subtract(result)
            elif Peek == '*':
                result = expr_multiply(result)
            else:
                result = expr_divide(result)

        emitln("Result: %d" % result)

Finally, with the while loop added to the mix, we have an expression parser
that will accept an arbitrarily long string of binary operations, maintain a
running result, and print the result at the end of the expression.

Operator Precedence
-------------------

Sadly, in compiler terms our evaluator is too much like a desk calculator,
and not enough like a programming language. The problem now is a lack of
support for "operator precedence."

Precedence and associativity are the properties of an operator that
determine the specific order in which an expression containing that operator
is evaluated. For example, which of the following is correct? ::

    1 + 3 * 5 = 20

    1 + 3 * 5 = 16

In fact, both of them are- you just have to perform the operations in a
different order. If you use a 4-function calculator to do this, you find
that it greedily evaluates each operation as soon as possible. The result is
that the expression is evaluated as (1+3)=4, and then (4*5)=20.

On the other hand, if you follow the generally-accepted rules of algebra,
you evaluate the sub-expression involving multiplication first, and then do
the addition. This resolves as (3*5)=15, and then (1+15)=16.

I don't know about you, but I am accustomed to counting on operator
precedence. I think we need to have it for any serious expression
evaluator. So let's add a test case::

    def test_mul_add_precedence(self):
        self.assertExpr("1+3*5", 16)
        self.assertExpr("9-6/2", 6)

Surprise! It doesn't pass::

    AssertionError: 'Result: 20' != 'Result: 16'
    - Result: 20
    ?         ^^
    + Result: 16
    ?         ^^

In our simple algebraic expressions, we need to differentiate between
addition and subtraction, with lower precedence, and multiplication and
division, with higher precedence. Our problems spring from binary operators,
so we don't have to worry about the numbers. What we have to worry about are
four different scenarios, determined by the operators:

#. term + term + term
#. term + factor x factor
#. factor x factor + term
#. factor x factor x factor

And in fact, two of those we don't have to worry about at all: when the
operators all have the same precedence there should be no problem. So let's
look at the two cases where the precedences are different. In case #2, we
know that the later subexpression should be resolved before we proceed. In
case #3, we know that the earlier subexpression should be resolved before
the later one.

Here's some pseudo-code, for use with additive operations::

    def additive:
        get a number, set it as our result
        if no followng operator, return the number
        read the operator
        get a number
        DO NOTHING, in case another operator has higher precedence
        look for another operator
        if no other operator,
            return the result of the operator on the two numbers.
        if the operator is multiplicative, go resolve that first
        if the operator is additive,
            set our result to the value of evaluating the prior operator
        proceed with the next operator

That's...awkward, at first. But let's look at multiplicative operators.
Here's a similar set of pseudo-code::

    def multiplicative:
        get a number, set it as our result
        if no following operator, return our result
        if the following operator is not multiplicative, return our result.
        read the operator
        get a number
        perform the operation, set our result
        if no following operator, return our result
        if the following operator is not multiplicative, return our result.
        read the opeator
        get a number
        perform the operation, set our result
        ...

That code actually looks pretty clean- I can see evidence of a loop in
there. Let's try some Python::

    def expr_mul():
        result = int(get_number())
        if not Peek in "*/":
            return result
        if op == '*':
            result = expr_multiply(result)
        elif op == '/':
            result = expr_divide(result)

        if not Peek in "*/":
            return result
        if op == '*':
            result = expr_multiply(result)
        elif op == '/':
            result = expr_divide(result)
        ...

Two things happen: first, the usefulness of writing those helper functions
to do all the checking and consuming becomes clear! Instead of worrying
about what kind of operator it is, we do one simple check and then just
delegate everything else. Sweet! Second, the loop *really* shows up in this
version. Just like before, we convert this to use a ``while`` and we're
done::

    def expr_mulop():
        """
        Handle multiplicative sub-expressions, with precedence.
        """
        result = int(get_number())
        while Peek is not None and Peek in "*/":
            if Peek == '*':
                result = expr_multiply(result)
            elif Peek == '/':
                result = expr_divide(result)
        return result

With the multiplicative case handled, let's go back and re-consider the
arithmetic case. There was a lot of checking in that case for multiplicative
operators. But if we have that function just call our `expr_mulop` function,
we won't need to worry about it. Without worrying about the multiplicative
operators, the additive case looks like this:

    def additive:
        get a number, or a multiplicative sub-expr
        if no operator, return the result.
        read an additive operator.
        get a number, or a multiplicative sub-expr
        evaluate the additive operator
        check for another operator
        ...

Suddenly, there is an obvious loop. And things look a lot more clear:

    def additive:
        call expr_mulop to handle number-or-higher-precedence
        while there is an add/subtract operator:
            if add operator:
                result = result + ????
            if subtract operator:
                result = result - ????
        return result

Notice how much that is shaped like the code for `expr_mulop`, above? That's
a good sign, I think. The two functions probably *should* look the same,
since they basically *are* the same except for precedence.

I put in a '????' in two places to point something out. The most direct
translation of what we were doing might tempt you to replace the '????' with
a call to `int(get_number)`. But we have to honor the precedence of the
operators on *both* sides of the operator. In fact, it's more important to
make sure the precedence is handled on the right than on the left- the
four-function version of this code got things right whenever the expression
was '2*3+4'. The problems only appear when it looks like '2+3*4' with the
lower precedence operator on the left. So make sure that the '????' is
replaced with another call to expr_mulop::

    if add operator:
        result = result + expr_mulop()
    if subtract operator
        result = result - expr_mulop()

Another thing: that was pseudo-code, but remember that we want to put all
the checking and operating in a separate subroutine. So let's make a stab at
the python version::

    def expr_addop():
        """
        Handle additive sub-expressions, with precedence.
        """
        result = expr_mulop()
        while Peek in "+-":
            if Peek == "+":
                result = expr_add(result)
            elif Peek == "-":
                result = expr_subtract(result)
        return result

And don't forget to update the helper functions to call `expr_mulop` instead
of calling `get_number`::

    def expr_add(num):
        match('+')
        num2 = expr_mulop()
        return num + num2

    def expr_subtract(num):
        match('-')
        num2 = expr_mulop()
        return num - num2


Let's add those two functions to the code, and change the `expression` to
call `expr_addop`.

I don't know about you, but when I did that I got a bunch of test failures.
I had to go fix up some places where I was testing multiple operators and I
used the flat 4-function calculator precedence instead of the standard
precedence. Also, my test case for detecting bogus operators has failed, and
I don't have a good idea about how to get it back.  I'm going to mark it as
`@unittest.skip` for now, in case I get smarter later on.  With that change
made, I'm back to all tests passing.

Parentheses
~~~~~~~~~~~

We're at a pretty good checkpoint right now. I'm going to copy my code,
which I have named `expr1.py` to a new source file, `expr2.py` so that I'll
have a stable version to revert back to.

Sometimes you need to override operator precedence. When you want an
additive operation to be done before a multiplicative one, the answer is to
use parentheses. Parens, for short, are an "operator" that has an even
higher precedence than multiplication. By definition, a parenthesized
sub-expression has the same precedence as a number. Here is a test case::

    def test_paren_expr(self):
        self.assertExpr("(3)", 3)
        self.assertExpr("(1+7)", 8)
        self.assertExpr("(1+1)*5", 10)


Without looking too far ahead, it's pretty obvious that variables are also
going to be treated just like numbers. So let's go ahead and create a
`expr_atom` function that will handle these cases for us. We'll define it to
take words, numbers, or parenthesized sub-expressions::

    def expr_atom():
        if Peek == '(':
            match('(')
            result = expression()
            match(')')
        elif Peek.isdigit():
            result = int(get_number())
        elif Peek.isalpha():
            raise NotImplementedError("No variables yet.")
        return result

Add this function to your code, and change the `expr_mul` function to call
`expr_atom` instead of `get_number`. Suddenly, the paren_expr test has a
weird error. What gives? ::

    TypeError: %d format: a number is required, not NoneType

Here's a hint: we weren't calling `expression` recursively before now. Oops!
Once that issue is fixed, the test cases all pass.

Unary Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There's one more thing we haven't dealt with yet in parsing expressions:
what if something comes with a negative (or positive) sign? Let's add a test
case, so we're clear on what I'm talking about::

    def test_unary_sign(self):
        self.assertExpr('-1', -1)
        self.assertExpr('-2*3', -6)
        self.assertExpr('+8-3', 5)

Yikes! Not only did it not work, but I didn't even get a nice looking error
message. This area definitely needs some work done on it!

The error message problem is because we are capturing all the output,
including stderr, in our test framework. That's my own fault, so I'll give
it a pass, for now.

The lack of support for a plus or minus sign is really a much larger problem
that is masked by the familiarity of the plus and minus. In reality, a
leading plus or minus is a completely different thing from a plus or minus
between two numbers. A leading minus is a *unary minus,* which is completely
different from the *binary minus* that appears between two numbers.

For comparison, consider the '&' operator in C. There are two flavors, a
unary and a binary flavor. The binary flavor represents *bitwise and* and
computes an integer result from integer arguments. The unary flavor
represents *address of* and computes a pointer result from any non-register
lvalue. Thus, 0x01 & 0xFF yields 0x01. But &foo yields a pointer value, the
address of the object referred to as 'foo'. The operators look the same -
the '&' character - but they have nothing to do with one another.

The same is true for unary and binary minus, or plus. We have to keep in
mind that they have a different syntax - unary vs. binary - and have
different meanings. And when we move towards compiling to executable code,
they will be probably be implemented with different opcodes.

With all that said, what are the rules for unary operators? In C, the unary
operators all share a common precedence level, and use order of appearance
to determin order of execution. I'll make the suggestion here that this is
not the only solution. We'll go with the 'C way' for now, but I'll revisit
this issue later, when we look at Boolean expressions.

So, if we are assigning unary operators a very high precedence, the obvious
place to insert them in the chain is right before `expr_atom`. We can create
an `expr_unary` rule, and add it between `expr_mul` and `expr_atom.`

Let's give that a try now::

    def expr_unary():
        """
        Handle unary operators, like +3 or -9.
        """
        if Peek in _unaryops_sw:
            op = get_char()
            fn = _unaryops_sw[op]
            num = expr_unary()
            result = fn(num)
        else:
            result = expr_atom()
        return result

Adding the link from `expr_mul` just means replacing calls to `expr_atom`
with calls to our new function. Go ahead and do that now, and see what the
test suite has to say. Done correctly, this should address the unary
problem. (Filling in the lambdas should be obvious.)
